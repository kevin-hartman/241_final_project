So, while I could sympathize, it was hard to truly put myself in their shoes as if it were actually me.  I was sad for them though and wished they weren't in that situation.  It was definitely unfair and callous of the other students to turn a coat into a reason to unfriend another person.   The conclusion though, I'm not too sure about.  Now parents that have already spent money on expensive coats which they may have only just barely been able to afford, but did so on behalf of their child's insistence, have to purchase another coat.   Also, sometimes brand names are slightly better quality and may actually be more affordable (if you can afford them upfront) because they last longer.  I don't think the answer is dictating what the students can and cannot wear.  It should be teaching them not to be so cruel.",Promoter,10,35 - 44,Female,Rural,Very Liberal,Very familiar,Definitely yes,,818550850,599eaf0fbfd73c00010ea24e,5dd4a34135582248315dfdca,5dde209a39bca1d5dafe30d0
